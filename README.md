## Research & Planning Log
### Saturday, 09/04
* 10:00pm: Write basic README and install create-react-app template.
* 10:15pm: Add to-do-list and project proposal 

### Sunday, 09/05
* 7am: Read about render props and higher-order components, in preparation for reading about hooks

## To-do list
* Research text chat applications in React -- not worrying about the drawing functionality, how would you make a basic chat app?
* Research drawing applications in React and Canvas -- not worrying about the chat app functionality, how would you make a basic drawing app?
* Research Firebase and NoSQL versus other backend alternatives -- see if it is suitable for a chat app, and also for real-time shared drawing (stretch goal feature)
* Research Socket.IO for real-time and Express for backend?
* Research React hooks -- What are they, do I need them? Or Redux?

## Notes
