# ScribbleChat
## By Shanen Cross
## Project's Purpose/Goal
Develop a real-time chat web app where you draw and send digital pictures as messages. Similar to the “PictoChat” software on the Nintendo DS handheld game console, combined with the functionality of a chat app like Discord.

## Minimum features that meet goal for MVP
* Users must enter a username in order to post
* Users can draw on a digital canvas with a standard brush tool, using a mouse
* Users can send their drawing to a live chat for other users to see
* Chat updates for all users in real-time
* Each chat message is labeled with its author’s username
* Chat messages are stored in the server and remain upon page refresh for all users


## Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whateverwill be used to create the MVP
* React
* create-react-app
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* HTML5 Canvas element
* Firebase with NoSQL

# Stretch goals beyond MVP
* Users can draw not only using a mouse, but also a touch screen
* Users can clear images from the canvas before sending
* Users can select any color for their brush
* Users can select any background color for their canvas
* Users can use other drawing tools, such as:
* Erase tool
* Fill tool
* Selection tool + Dragging and Dropping selection + Deleting selection
* Other brush types (brush, pencil)
* Edit line thickness
* Draw line
* Draw rectangle
* Draw oval
* Users can “undo” and “redo” drawing actions
* Users can “scribble share”, similar to “screen sharing” or streaming in Discord, sharing a canvas that users can draw on simultaneously in real-time, in addition to the normal drawing chat
* Users can scribble share to all users, or to select members
* Users can type text onto their canvases, in addition to drawing
* Users can upload images to draw on top of or edit in their canvas
* Users can DM (direct message) another user or a combination of users for private conversation
* Chat messages are labeled with timestamps
* Users must register/login with a user-name and password
* Without a password, users are labeled as anonymous
* Users have roles: Mods, members, and anonymous users
* Users can erase their own messages, mods can erase any messages
* Mods can ban users
* Users can edit their messages, marking them with an “edited” label and timestamp
* Users can chat in multiple “channels” for different categories of discussion
* Mods can create, rename, and delete channels
* What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Possibly other tools/libraries for drawing features
* Possibly other tools/libraries for “scribble share” feature of drawing with other users in real-time on the same canvas
* Possibly other tools/libraries for user login/registration and roles
* Possibly other tools/libraries for advanced chat features like channels, erasing messages, banning, etc.
* Research into specific tools/libraries needs to be done
